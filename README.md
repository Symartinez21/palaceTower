# Artist Statement
<p> I love the low-poly aesthetic of classic video game consoles from the 90s and early 2000s, so I created a scene inspired by those aesthetics and the sandbox environment. The textures and low meshes save rendering power that brings the audience into a familiar world reminiscent of the Frutiger Aero and Memphis aesthetics. All of the assets were made in Blender, and appear in the scene using the GLTFLoader. Your character spawns in the tower and using PointerLockControls, you can control the movement and camera to jump across the cloud platforms. If you fall off the platform, your character can float in the air and control your descent. <p>
